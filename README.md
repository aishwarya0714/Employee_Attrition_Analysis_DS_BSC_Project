# Employee_Attrition_Analysis_DS_BSC_Project

## This project is part of my B.Sc. Data Science program and demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. The focus of this project is on Employee Attrition Analysis aims to give you a way to leverage machine learning to better understand your employees.

We have moved within the past month from an environment of
historically tight global labor markets to one of widespread
unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Employee attrition analytics will remain important to organizations
seeking to retain top talent; even in times of high unemployment, top
performers are always in demand and there is competition for their
talents.
 Employee attrition analytics is specifically focused on identifying why
employees voluntarily leave, what might have prevented them from
leaving, and how we can use data to predict attrition risk.
